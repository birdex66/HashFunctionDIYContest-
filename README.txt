# HashFunctionDIYContest-
Team birdex:
This program creates the hash function based on the assumption that the consonants(per word) in the data given represent a normal distribution. as such, the function seperates the Q1 and Q3 of the distribution, leaving
3 partitions. Partitions 1 and 3 represent 33% of the data overall, while Partition 2 represents 66 of the overall data, akin to a normal distribution. A simpler hash function was added in case the base case of 30 elements
for data to represent a normal distribution wasnt met. Did not have time to implement.
